## Project Title: 
FaceSafe: On-Device Authentication & Gesture Recognition

## Project Description:
Recognize individual face for authentication and gestures for action identification.

## Key Objectives:
- Privacy: On-device execution would prevent leakage of facial features and repeated gestures
- Real-time Processing: Ensuring that face and gesture recognition runs efficiently and can provide real-time feedback without noticeable delay.
- Robustness: Make the system robust to variations in lighting, angles, facial expressions, and hand positioning, ensuring reliable performance across different environments.

## Usability
- Classroom attendance: streamline classroom access control and automate the attendance-taking process.
- Smart Home features: user performs a predefined gesture, such as swiping their hand up to increase room lighting or making a circle motion to play music
- Office and Workspace Security:

-Employee Authentication: FaceSafe can be integrated with office security systems to allow only authorized personnel into restricted areas. This provides a secure, touchless access control method.
Meeting Room Management: By recognizing team members as they enter, the system could automatically log attendance or start pre-scheduled meetings.
Healthcare Monitoring:

-Patient Identification: In medical facilities, FaceSafe can be used to identify patients, ensuring accurate and secure patient records without relying on keycards or badges.
Gesture-Based Alerts: Patients could use gestures to signal for assistance, making it easier for those with limited mobility to request help without pressing buttons.
Retail and Public Spaces:

-Customer Insights: In retail stores, FaceSafe can offer customized experiences based on recognized faces, such as greeting loyalty members or adjusting in-store advertisements.
Interactive Kiosks: In public spaces or malls, users could interact with digital kiosks via gestures, providing a touch-free, intuitive interface for information access.
Vehicle Access and Control:

-Driver Authentication: FaceSafe can secure vehicle access, allowing only recognized faces to unlock and start the vehicle.
Gesture-Controlled Dashboard: Drivers could adjust settings (e.g., volume, climate control) using gestures, promoting safer, hands-free operation.
Each application enhances convenience, security, and user experience, demonstrating FaceSafeâ€™s adaptability to various real-world scenarios.

## Technology Stack:
Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3, PyTorch, Python

## Expected Outcomes:
Develop a fully functional prototype that can recognize individual faces for authentication and specific gestures for action identification.
