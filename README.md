## Project Title: 
FaceSafe: On-Device Authentication & Gesture Recognition

## Project Description:
Recognize individual face for authentication and gestures for action identification.

## Key Objectives:
- Privacy: On-device execution would prevent leakage of facial features and repeated gestures
- Real-time Processing: Ensuring that face and gesture recognition runs efficiently and can provide real-time feedback without noticeable delay.
- Robustness: Make the system robust to variations in lighting, angles, facial expressions, and hand positioning, ensuring reliable performance across different environments.

## Usability
- Classroom attendance: streamline classroom access control and automate the attendance-taking process.
- Smart Home features: user performs a predefined gesture, such as swiping their hand up to increase room lighting or making a circle motion to play music

## Technology Stack:
Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3, PyTorch, Python

## Expected Outcomes:
Develop a fully functional prototype that can recognize individual faces for authentication and specific gestures for action identification.

## Timeline:
(Provide a rough timeline or milestones for the project)
- Week 1: Initial Setup and Requirements Analysis
- Week 2: Model Development
- Week 3, 4: System Integration and On-Device Deployment
- Week 5: Evaluation, documentation
